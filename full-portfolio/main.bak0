Met research partner, Viren Bankapur, by networking through ISEF 2024: Remotely collaborated on this project over 
Summer 2024 and the school year. GaitGuardian was Viren's project at ISEF 2024, and I joined to help expand the system 
with my embedded systems and ML expertise.

            \item Plano ISD grades subjects using GPA brackets, where 97-100 is an A+
            \item Plano ISD only considers "Ranking" courses for GPA, and CBE and E-School are excluded
            \item All honors courses have a 4.5 GPA, and all AP and Engineering courses have a 5.0 GPA weight
            \item My class rank will likely drop to 2 or 3 due to AP Precalculus mistake (District error)
            \item *Digital Electronics grade is still yet to be finalized
