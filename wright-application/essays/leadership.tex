\begin{enumerate}
	\item I founded the Cricket Club at my current high school. As a founder, I was responsible for
	      popularizing the club itself by recruiting members and advertising through Instagram and word-of-mouth. I
	      organized practice sessions and I had to act as both a player and a coach, teaching new players the rules and
	      pushing them through the sport's steep learning curve. Each practice itself proved a hurdle, as I had to
	      find enough people to play at a common place and time, manage equipment, and ensure that everyone was engaged.
	      Due to the nature of a first year club, I had to help bridge the high delta between experienced and new players,
	      ensuring that everyone had fun while still being challenged. Then, I had to organize matches with other
	      local high school teams, which involved coordinating with their club leaders, arranging transportation, and
	      managing logistics. Through sponsorships from local businesses and colleges (UTD, RICE, DBU), I was able to
	      fund equipment and provide support for club matches.
	\item I serve as the Co-Captain and Software Lead for my school's First Tech Challenge (FTC) Robotics team.
	      As the only programmer of our initially rookie team, I was fully writing out every line of code for our robot.
	      However, funds became a major hurdle, so I also filled in to help secure a \$750 sponsorship from Texas Instruments
	      through outreach events. As our team grew, I had to take on recruiting of new members, carefully selecting students who
	      would be a good fit for our programming and engineering needs. Once our team reached 5 programmers, I fully
	      transformed our repository into a GitHub organization, with multiple repositories
	      for each team member to experiment with
	      hands-on. I also had to delegate specific tasks and manage deadlines to ensure that our software development stayed on track.
	      For the FTC competition, I was also in charge
	      of documenting our software iterations and innovations, which proved crucial in winning multiple awards
	      for software design and innovation.
	\item I am the Vice President (and former underclassmen president) of my school's Science Fair Club.
	      As an officer, it is my role to fully lead and plan our club's biweekly lunch meetings. This involves brainstorming engaging
	      activities with other officers, and preparing 35-40 minutes detailed presentations on various aspects of science fair projects.
	      I have prepared extensive materials on project brainstorming, project methodology, data analysis, and trifold tips to help guide
	      over 90 active club members. Additionally, I help students one-on-one through email or in-person (after meetings) to share
	      my experience to help students make the right decisions. Finally, as a student who has been intimidated by
	      the science fair process, I plan and cater my presentations to help lower the barrier to entry for new students and underclassmen,
	      recruiting members by making science fair more approachable.
	\item From halfway in my 9th grade to now, I have started, owned, and am fully maintaining a Discord study server for our school's
	      student class of 2027. As the owner, I am fully responsible for a managing a team of 8 voted moderators, and I have
	      to ensure that everybody's voices are heard. As the server is run through Discord, arguments and disagreements can
	      easily escalate, so I have to step in as a neutral party to mediate and resolve conflicts. It was through these Discord
	      "blow-ups" that I started learning how to be a better leader and work with others. I have poured over 300 hours into
	      this server, managing over 100 active members. Housing over 50\% of the class (at its peak) was a daunting task, and I
	      had to deal with revolts and mass exodus of members multiple times. From arguments about the "wetness of water" to
	      kicking me out of my own server, I have seen and managed all of these conflicts. Now, our server is a stable and
	      thriving community, with valuable study resources, popular group study calls, and constant member engagement through
	      general (and of-topic) text channels.
