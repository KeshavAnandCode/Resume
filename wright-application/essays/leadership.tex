\begin{enumerate}
	\item I am the founder and president of the Cricket Club at my current high school. I identified a gap in our school's athletic program and built the Cricket Club into a sustainable organization with over 25 active members. As the founder, I marketed the club through Instagram campaigns and personal networks to recruit members. I planned and implemented biweekly practices while serving as both a player and coach, helping new members overcome the sport’s steep learning curve. This required coordinating schedules and logistics for more than 25 members per practice. As a first-year organization, I also worked to bridge the skill gap between experienced players and beginners to ensure an inclusive and enjoyable experience for all members.

	\item I serve as Co-Captain and Software Lead for my school's First Tech Challenge (FTC) Robotics team. As the sole programmer on our initially rookie team, I developed the entire competition robot codebase from scratch. When funding became a challenge, I secured a \$750 sponsorship from Texas Instruments through multi-faceted outreach. As the team expanded, I recruited new members based on programming and engineering needs. Once the team grew to five programmers, I restructured our workflow by creating a GitHub organization with multiple repositories to support collaboration and version control. I delegated tasks and managed development timelines, and I led documentation of software iterations and technical innovations that contributed to winning the Innovate and Control awards.

	\item I serve as Vice President (and former underclassmen president) of my school's Science Fair Club. I lead biweekly lunch meetings for over 90 active members, collaborating with fellow officers to design engaging activities and delivering 35--40 minute presentations on key aspects of science fair projects. I have developed instructional materials covering project brainstorming, methodology, data analysis, and trifold design. I also provide one-on-one mentorship via email and in-person consultations, helping students navigate project decisions based on my competition experience. Drawing from my own initial intimidation with the process, I design presentations to lower the barrier to entry and make science fair more accessible to new students.

	\item From halfway through my 9th grade to the present, I have founded, owned, and maintained a Discord study server for my school's class of 2027. As the server owner, I oversee eight democratically elected moderators and have implemented systems to ensure all members have a voice in decision-making. Because online disputes can escalate quickly, I frequently act as a neutral arbitrator to mediate conflicts. I have invested over 300 hours into managing the server, which at its peak supported over 50\% of the student body and more than 100 active members.

	\item I serve as the Chemistry Officer (and former Math Officer) for my school's tutoring club, ACE. My primary responsibility is supervising student volunteers who create Chemistry review materials by delegating units and topics and reviewing all resources for accuracy and clarity. I also organize and monitor live AP Chemistry tutoring sessions, both in person and via Zoom, serving 20--30 students per session. My most demanding responsibility is stepping in to complete unfinished materials or host sessions when volunteers are unavailable, requiring flexible availability to ensure uninterrupted academic support.

	\item I serve as the Technology Officer for my school's National Honor Society chapter. In addition to managing technical responsibilities, I moderate service events involving over 200 student volunteers, overseeing participant behavior and ensuring effective execution of service activities. I also represent my chapter at leadership conferences such as LEAD, where I collaborate with officers from other NHS chapters to exchange and develop leadership strategies.

	\item In my freshman year, I served as an officer for my school's Math Club. I presented approximately one-quarter of weekly meetings to over 15 students, designing and delivering engaging lessons on mathematical applications such as card tricks and calculator programming. I was also responsible for maintaining detailed attendance records to track eligibility requirements for the Mu Alpha Theta honor society.
