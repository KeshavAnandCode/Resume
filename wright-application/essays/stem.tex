In the last three years, STEM activities have been the focus of my high school experience, both through and outside of school.
I have had a strong passion towards STEM activities since middle school, and I believe that these experiences have prepared me
to fully utilize the research platforms and opportunities provided by AFRL.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item From 9th to 11th grade, I served as Co-Captain and Software Lead for my community's First Tech Challenge (FTC) Robotics team. Beginning freshman year with no programming experience, I taught myself Java through the FTC SDK and progressed to developing fully functional robot code that contributed to our team reaching the State Finals and winning the Area Innovate Award for a fully automated hang mechanism. Over the following two years, I significantly deepened my technical contributions. By applying calculus concepts learned in the classroom, I engineered a custom autonomous pathing system using trigonometry, inverse kinematics, and PID control to achieve precise robot movement. I also developed a custom TensorFlow object detection model, achieving a 100\% match success rate across all competitions. These innovations helped our team win our league championship, captain an Area Finalist alliance, and rank in the global top 30 for autonomous performance.

	\item In 9th grade, my independent Science Fair research project qualified as a finalist at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF). The project originated from a simple idea: using waste thermal energy from a cooking pot to power a mechanical stirring system. Through this process, I learned about thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and the Seebeck effect. Applying CAD and simulation concepts from my engineering coursework, I designed an aluminum enclosure integrating a TEG, heat sink, and motor to convert thermal energy into mechanical motion. I also developed an electrical measurement system using voltage and current sensors to analyze system performance relative to temperature differentials. My prototype won 1st place in Engineering Technology at my regional science fair, along with special awards from the U.S. Metric Association and the U.S. Air Force Certificate of Recognition. At ISEF, I presented my work to professors and domain experts from around the world and received valuable feedback to further refine my design.

	\item In 10th grade, my Science Fair research project earned 3rd place in Robotics and Intelligent Machines at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF). Motivated by relatives affected by Parkinson’s Disease, I explored machine learning approaches for gait and tremor analysis. Using publicly available datasets, I designed a novel signal processing pipeline capable of accurately classifying gait patterns with low inference latency. After training and validating multiple models, I expanded the project by developing a physical prototype. With guidance from my engineering teacher, I designed a custom PCB featuring an ESP32 microcontroller and an IMU sensor capable of performing real-time inference. Through independent study of academic literature and online resources, I taught myself Python and C++ to fully implement the system. Initially recognized at the regional level, the project won 1st place in Systems Software, the TI Best Computing Project Award, and 2nd Grand Prize, qualifying me for ISEF for a second year. At ISEF, it earned 3rd place in Robotics and Intelligent Machines and a \$1{,}200 award.

	\item This year, I maintained a full-time home server by repurposing a decade-old laptop with Ubuntu Linux. Through hands-on experimentation, I self-learned bash scripting, networking, Linux administration, and service management. I deployed a Matrix messaging server for student communication, a Git server for code hosting, and an SSH service with a custom interactive shell displaying my portfolio. Despite over one million automated attacks within two months, my hardened security measures prevented any successful intrusions, providing me with practical experience in networking, cybersecurity, and infrastructure management.

	\item In 9th grade, I qualified for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) through the AMC~10. By self-studying with online resources, I developed strong problem-solving skills focused on logical reasoning, speed, and optimality. I participated in and placed at various competitions, including Purple Comet and Math League. I also contribute solutions on the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum using LaTeX to clearly communicate my reasoning. Additionally, I have created Geometry and Calculus problems for use in my school’s ACE tutoring club.

	\item In 10th grade, I created a real-time audio visualization system for live musical performances. I developed a Python pipeline that converts MIDI input into audio using a piano VST, then processes the signal with the \texttt{librosa} library to visualize frequency components via Fast Fourier Transforms. By leveraging MIDI’s low-latency input, the system achieves near-instant visual response, enabling live performers to produce professional concert visuals without expensive hardware or post-production software.

	\item In 10th grade, I developed a debate utility web application using React and TypeScript to address inefficiencies in tournament operations. The platform includes precise timing software with graphical notifications and audio alerts, as well as an automated presiding officer system implemented using the WebSocket API to ensure real-time synchronization among moderators and participants. The application has been tested, used, and positively reviewed by national finalists and members of my school’s debate team.
