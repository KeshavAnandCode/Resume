\begin{enumerate}
	\item I have been working for a local ticketed nonprofit band for three years as a Keyboard player.
	      As a musician, I am expected to fully practice my parts individually to a level of near-mastery. Each concert will demand at least
	      3-4 section practices, where I have to coordinate with other musicians in my section to ensure that we are in sync.
	      Teamwork is a relative struggle, and each of us has differing opinions on the best way to play a specific piece. I
	      have learned to offer my input respectfully and to avoid heated arguments by focusing on the music itself. Full band
	      practices are also held for each performance, where attendance is absolutely mandatory. Each musician contributes to the final song,
	      and missing a practice would lead to a lack of cohesion in the final performance. In this band, I ensure that I attend every
	      practice and performance, and I have never had an absence or reprimand. Although our final work is paid through ticket sales,
	      all revenue is donated to local charities, and I take pride in knowing that my work is helping those in need.
