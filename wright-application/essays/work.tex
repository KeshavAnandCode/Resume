\begin{enumerate}
	\item I have been working for a local ticketed nonprofit band for three years as a keyboard player. As a musician, I am expected to fully practice my parts individually to a level of near-mastery. Each concert requires at least three to four section rehearsals, where I coordinate closely with other musicians in my section to ensure synchronization. Teamwork can be challenging, as each musician often has differing opinions on interpretation, but I have learned to contribute respectfully and avoid conflict by focusing discussions on the music itself. Full-band rehearsals are mandatory for every performance, and attendance is critical, as each musician contributes to the final cohesion of the piece. I have attended every rehearsal and performance without a single absence or reprimand. Although performances generate revenue through ticket sales, all proceeds are donated to local charities, and I take pride in knowing that my work supports those in need.

	\item For three years, I have served as an NSDA-certified judge for middle school debate tournaments in my local area. My responsibilities include evaluating debaters on argumentation quality, speaking style, and providing constructive written feedback. Each tournament lasts an entire day, during which I often judge six or more rounds with minimal breaks. I am expected to remain focused and impartial throughout, as bias would undermine the integrity of the competition. Once I confirm availability, I am required to judge all assigned rounds, as tournaments depend on strict schedules. One of my greatest challenges has been setting aside personal political views when judging arguments I strongly agree or disagree with. I overcame this by prioritizing argument structure, evidence, and delivery over content. In addition to judging, I help write topics, review updated rules, and report behavioral incidents. Overall, I have judged over 50 rounds without a single absence, and I strive to be a fair and consistent adjudicator.

	\item During my 11th grade, I volunteered as my school’s NHS Technology Officer. As my school has over 1{,}000 members in its NHS chapter, service hour logging must be handled digitally through a highly performant database. As Technology Officer, I am responsible for maintaining both the database and the full-stack portal UI used by members to log and track service hours. One of my duties is attending every service event hosted, as any technical failure could disrupt hour logging for hundreds of students. Additionally, handling sensitive student information, including emails and passwords, requires strict confidentiality. Given the number of students impacted by this system, I hold myself highly accountable and ensure consistent availability to debug and resolve technical issues.

	\item In my 10th and 11th grades, I volunteered as a tutor to support struggling students at my high school. Through my school’s ACE tutoring program and my independently run study Discord server, I have supported students in Calculus, Chemistry, and History. Each session requires careful preparation to ensure concepts are explained intuitively. I have consistently received positive feedback and always prioritize student understanding and academic growth. Working with academically challenged students has required me to adapt my teaching methods, and I strive to guide students toward mastery of each subject.

	\item For my FTC outreach, I volunteered as both a mentor and a field referee. As a mentor, my role is to keep students engaged and support their technical growth. Working primarily with middle school students, I guide them by providing curated resources such as documentation and instructional links so they can continue learning independently. As a field referee, my responsibility is to accurately track scored elements and penalties. Because fouls can be a source of controversy, I also mediate disputes between teams and handle referrals calmly and respectfully. I always strive to officiate fairly and uphold the integrity of the competition.

	\item In my 9th grade, I founded a tutoring company to teach middle school students competitive mathematics. The service emphasized a problem-based approach rather than traditional topic-based instruction, focusing on critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As the sole operator, I was responsible for recruiting clients, scheduling sessions, and preparing lesson plans.
